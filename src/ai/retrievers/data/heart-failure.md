# Heart Failure (HF)

**Definition:** Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet the metabolic demands of the body, or to do so only at elevated filling pressures.

**Classification:**
-   **HFrEF (Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction):** LVEF ≤ 40%. Also known as systolic heart failure.
-   **HFpEF (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction):** LVEF ≥ 50%. Also known as diastolic heart failure.
-   **HFmrEF (Heart Failure with mildly reduced Ejection Fraction):** LVEF 41-49%.

**Common Causes:**
-   Ischemic Heart Disease (Coronary Artery Disease)
-   Hypertension
-   Valvular Heart Disease
-   Cardiomyopathies
-   Diabetes Mellitus

**Clinical Manifestations:**
-   **Left-sided HF:** Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), pulmonary edema (crackles).
-   **Right-sided HF:** Peripheral edema, jugular venous distention (JVD), ascites, hepatomegaly.
-   **General:** Fatigue, weakness.

**Key Investigations:**
-   **Echocardiogram:** To assess ejection fraction, wall motion, and valvular function.
-   **BNP/NT-proBNP:** Elevated levels support a diagnosis of HF.
-   **ECG:** To look for underlying ischemia, hypertrophy, or arrhythmias.
-   **Chest X-ray:** To assess for cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion.

**Management of HFrEF (Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy - GDMT):**
1.  **ACE Inhibitors (e.g., Ramipril) or ARBs (e.g., Valsartan) or ARNI (Sacubitril/Valsartan).**
2.  **Beta-Blockers (e.g., Metoprolol Succinate, Carvedilol, Bisoprolol).**
3.  **Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRA) (e.g., Spironolactone).**
4.  **SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin).**
