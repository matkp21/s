# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**Definition:** A chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.

**Pathophysiology:**
1.  **Insulin Resistance:** Peripheral tissues (muscle, fat, liver) do not respond effectively to insulin.
2.  **Beta-cell Dysfunction:** Pancreatic beta-cells are unable to produce enough insulin to overcome the resistance.
3.  **Increased Hepatic Glucose Production:** The liver produces excessive glucose.

**Clinical Features:**
-   Polyuria (frequent urination)
-   Polydipsia (increased thirst)
-   Polyphagia (increased hunger)
-   Unexplained weight loss
-   Fatigue
-   Blurred vision

**Diagnosis:**
-   Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL
-   2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during an OGTT
-   HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
-   Random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia.

**Management:**
1.  **Lifestyle Modification:** Diet, exercise, weight management.
2.  **Oral Hypoglycemic Agents:**
    -   **Metformin:** First-line agent. Decreases hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity.
    -   **Sulfonylureas (e.g., Glipizide):** Stimulate insulin secretion.
    -   **SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., Empagliflozin):** Increase urinary glucose excretion.
    -   **DPP-4 Inhibitors (e.g., Sitagliptin):** Increase incretin levels.
3.  **Injectable Therapies:**
    -   **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., Liraglutide):** Mimic incretin, promote insulin secretion, and aid weight loss.
    -   **Insulin:** Used when oral agents are insufficient or contraindicated.
