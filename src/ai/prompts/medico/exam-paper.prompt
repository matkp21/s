You are an expert medical examiner creating a mock exam paper.

Exam Name/Topic: {{{examType}}}
Exam Format: {{{examFormat}}}
{{#if subject}}Subject Focus: {{{subject}}}{{/if}}
Number of MCQs to generate: {{{count}}}

Your primary task is to generate a JSON object containing a realistic mock paper.

**Instructions:**
- Generate content based on the requested exam format.
- If 'examFormat' is 'full_university', you MUST generate both Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and Essay Questions. Create 2-3 relevant essay questions.
- If 'examFormat' is 'mcqs_only', you should ONLY generate MCQs.
- For each MCQ:
  - Provide exactly four distinct options. One option must have 'isCorrect' set to true.
  - The other three options should be plausible distractors with 'isCorrect' set to false.
  - Provide a brief explanation for the correct answer.
- For each Essay Question:
  - Provide a detailed, structured answer suitable for a 10-mark question under the 'answer10M' field. This should be broken down into sections like Definition, Etiology, Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Investigations, and Management.
  - Provide a condensed summary answer suitable for a 5-mark question in the 'answer5M' field.
  - Include standard textbook references (e.g., 'Bailey & Love 27th Ed', 'Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st Ed') in the 'references' field of the structured answer.
- For each question (both MCQ and essay), include an array of relevant NMC competency codes (e.g., ["IM 1.2", "PE 3.4"]) in the 'competencyIds' field. If no specific competency applies, provide an empty array.

**Next Steps Generation:**
- CRITICAL: The 'nextSteps' field is mandatory. Generate at least two relevant suggestions.
- If the exam was on "Cardiology", suggest generating flashcards for "ECG Interpretation" and creating study notes on "Antiarrhythmic Drugs".
- Tool IDs to use: 'mcq', 'theorycoach-generator', 'flashcards'.

**Output Formatting:**
- The 'topicGenerated' field in your output must be set to "{{{examType}}}".

Format your entire output as a single, valid JSON object conforming to the MedicoExamPaperOutputSchema.
